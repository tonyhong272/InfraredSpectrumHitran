# InfraredSpectrumHitran
this repository plots the infrared spectra of the gases at different conditions with data from HITRAN.
I feel it is more convinient to have a local software to plot these spectra with massive data instead of doing it using a browser from a remote website. This program allows adjustment of gas concentration, gas temperature, mixtures and broadening. 

HITRAN is a database of molecular absorption spectra maintained by scientists in Harvard University and elsewhere. 
Please download the HITRAN data (https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/HITRAN/HITRAN2012/HITRAN2012/By-Molecule/Uncompressed-files/) into PAR folders.
